b0nk.cf DDoS API and CodeTheWorld authentication API command injection 0-day

Two simple command injection 0-day exploits I made for the [authentication API](https://github.com/CTWSec/-C-Auth-Server-Side-Files) by CodeTheWorld, just to clown r00ntu/co9/b0nk/Jeff the eGod (skid).

These exploits can also be used executed on his DDoS API through the **key** parameter.

Nigga said his APIs wasn't vulnerable, and that I was the biggest skid in the world, who wouldn't be able find or exploit any vulnerabilities in them, which is pretty ironic.
