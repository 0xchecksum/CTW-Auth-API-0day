# CTW Auth API 0day

CodeTheWorld authentication API command injection 0-day

Two simple command injection 0-days I made for the [authentication API](https://github.com/CTWSec/-C-Auth-Server-Side-Files) by CodeTheWorld, just to clown r00ntu/co9/b0nk/Jeff the eGod (skid).

(nigga said the API wasn't vulnerable and that I was the biggest skid in the world who couldn't find or exploit any vulnerabilities in it, which is pretty ironic)
